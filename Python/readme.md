Maybe its nice that many possible dates are found in these cities. But you also want your date to pay for you "Of course"!



## Assignment 2
### You dont want to work in paradise!

In paradise you should not work! Therefore you find a partner that can make your living for you!
Find out which of the cities within Copenhangen, that have the lowest unemployment rate, to maximize the chance of getting a date that have a job. 

Now you have to compare the cities of Assignment 1 with the cities that have lowest unemployment rate.
